# TODO

## List Messages

- I think because it is not fully fetching the emails
- Alternately, fetched emails are not reaching the reader
- The client ought to fetch more emails when the reader is on the last page of the list view
- The list ought to sort from newest to oldest
- The list ought to be searchable with a regex

## Compose

- Not implemented at all
- Needs to be editable, and sendable

## Caching Layer

- The client layer for email needs to have an intermediary that caches already-fetched messages up to a config limit
- The config needs to have a limit (10? 10K? IDK)


## Reader

- Doesn't work
